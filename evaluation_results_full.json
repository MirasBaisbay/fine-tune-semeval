OnTheWight covers a variety of topics related to the Isle of Wight community. Their reporting includes local news, events, politics, and community issues. For instance, they emphasize community-focused stories, like thecollaboration between Tesco and Isle of Wight residentsfor a food allergy awareness campaign. Further, they provide detailed reports on local infrastructure projects, such as the\u201cSouthern Water details \u00a321.5 million investment in Isle of Wight infrastructure over five years.\u201d Additionally, they publish reports such as\u201cBonchurch Landslide: Leeson Road \u2013 Comprehensive Report from Public Meeting,\u201dwhich covers a public meeting discussing a landslide in Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, affecting Leeson Road. The report includes detailed accounts from officials and residents about the causes, impacts, and potential solutions for the landslide. Key points include concerns about road safety, infrastructure damage, and proposed measures to prevent future incidents. The article aims to summarize the meeting thoroughly, reflecting community involvement and local government responses. It is informative and focused on local issues, presenting facts and statements from the meeting without noticeable bias. In contrast, their political coverage can show bias in wording and framing. For example, the article\u201cLetter: HS2 \u2013 A casualty of Brexit or Tory mismanagement?\u201dsuggests a critical view of Brexit and the Conservative Party. The title and content use terms like \u201ccasualty\u201d and \u201cmismanagement,\u201d which carry negative connotations and imply a failure on the part of the government. The framing directs readers to consider Brexit and the Conservative administration as primary reasons for the HS2 project\u2019s difficulties without presenting counterarguments or diverse perspectives indicating a left-leaning bias, focusing on political critique rather than a balanced analysis. In conclusion, OnTheWight demonstrates a mix of neutral reporting on community and infrastructure topics and comprehensive and factual reporting on local issues while occasionally exhibiting left-leaning bias in its political coverage.",
