**History:**

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the world's leading public service broadcaster, established in 1922 by John Reith. It began as a radio service and has since expanded to include a wide array of television, radio, and online services. The BBC was established by a Royal Charter and is funded primarily through a licence fee paid by UK households. Over the years, it has played a pivotal role in informing, educating, and entertaining audiences both in the UK and globally. Key milestones include its regulation by Ofcom and its continued operation under a Royal Charter.

**Funded by / Ownership:**

The BBC is publicly owned by the UK and operates under a Royal Charter. It is funded through a public licence fee, which is mandatory for UK households with television. The headquarters is located in London, England. The funding model ensures that the BBC remains a public service broadcaster, though it has faced criticism regarding the fairness of the licence fee from commercial competitors.

**Analysis / Bias:**

The BBC exhibits a Left-Center bias in its reporting, which is evident in its editorial stance and story selection. In reviewing articles, we found that the BBC supports progressive narratives, particularly in areas such as healthcare, social issues, and economic policy. For example, the BBC has highlighted systemic problems in healthcare and economic inequality, using loaded language such as "health horror stories" and "extremes of inequality." This choice of language suggests a critical view of the current economic and social systems, aligning with left-leaning perspectives.

External analyses provide mixed reviews of the BBC's impartiality. While Media Bias/Fact Check rates the BBC as "Least Biased" with "Mostly Factual" reporting, other sources like AllSides note a Left-Center bias, reflecting ongoing debates about its impartiality. Criticism of the BBC often centers on perceived lack of objectivity, with accusations coming from both the left and right.
