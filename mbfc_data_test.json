They may utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports, and omit information that may damage conservative causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy.See all Right Bias sources. Established in 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The main purpose is to detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events. The VAERS websitedisclaimsthat “anyone can report an adverse event to VAERS” and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this articleUnderstanding causality in adverse events after vaccinationas a way to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally. While the website does not alter information obtained from VAERS, they publish numbers on Covid-19 that may be misleading as these stats are not vetted and most likely are not accurate. For example, they list Covid Vaccine Deaths as over 11K as of today. They also list over 1000 miscarriages and close to 5000 heart attacks. This data may have been entered into VAERS, but there is zero evidence to support the validity of these claims. The OpenVAERS website also features a blog with a right-leaning bias that promotes vaccine hesitation. For example, in this articleOpenVAERS Call to Actionwritten by the anonymous “The Arkivist,” they state, “The mainstream narrative completely fell apart this week. In spite of an aggressive propaganda campaign by the Biden White House, it is now clear that coronavirus “vaccines” do not stop infection, transmission, nor hospitalizations and deaths in the vaccinated.” Further, in this blog post, they take the literal VAERS numbers to promote misinformation such as this “these shots have produced four times more fatalities than the terrorist attacks on 9/11.” At this point,there is little evidenceanyone has died as a direct result of the vaccine. In general, OpenVAERS does not alter data from the VAERS database; however, they do take the numbers literally and often come to false or misleading conclusions that cannot be proven.",

Open to Debate employs a debate format for discussing political issues, aiming to offer balanced viewpoints by selecting diverse topics and debaters. However, our analysis is based on summaries and participant backgrounds, not full hour-long debate videos. We also analyzed a comedy event based on a provided transcript. The debate“Mock Trial: Is Trump Guilty in the January 6th Case?”featuresLanny Davis, a background in politics and law, andSara Azari, a criminal defense attorney/legal analyst forCNNand prominent networks. While Davis is associated with liberal politics, Azari’s political leanings remain unclear. Our examination of Azari’sinterviewfrom the Women Criminal Defense Attorneys blog found no explicit references to her political leanings; her focus is on legal expertise and education. Legal expertsJoel CohenandRandall Eliasonadd depth, but their political affiliations are not explicitly known. The Debate’s structure allows for in-depth exploration of arguments, but potential bias may arise from participants’ backgrounds and leanings. The Debate’s impartiality depends on moderation and cross-examiners’ effectiveness in balancing discussions. Our analysis of Open to Debate, especially the “Mock Trial: Is Trump Guilty in the January 6th Case?” debate, is limited by video length and accessibility. We drew conclusions from the debate structure, participants’ backgrounds, and the platform’s overall approach. While these elements suggest an intention for balanced discussion, a full assessment of impartiality requires a thorough review of complete debate content. Therefore, while indications of a balanced approach are present, a definitive assessment of overall impartiality is not possible within this analysis. Additionally, based on the providedtranscript, we analyzed live comedy events from Open to Debate. The event“Is Wokeness Killing Comedy?”examines whether wokeness restricts comedians and stifles comedic creativity or enhances comedy by broadening its scope and promoting social consciousness. Both debaters provide differing viewpoints. Lou Perez argues that wokeness, focusing on power structures and the potential for censorship, harms comedic creativity and freedom. Michael Ian Black counters that comedy is more successful than ever, with wokeness contributing to thoughtfulness and inclusivity, expanding the range of voices in the field. The platform encourages balanced discussions and diverse viewpoints, aligning with Open to Debate’s commitment to encompassing multiple perspectives in its content. While Open to Debate has not directly failed a fact-check, some of the debaters havefailed fact-checks, such asAnthony Scaramucci, who was briefly Press Secretary for Former President Trump. Finally, it is also difficult to individually verify debaters’ claims as they may not always provide a source for the information they present.",

In review, Open Doors’primary missionis to empower Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs. They do this by providing financial help and Bibles to those in countries with significant Christian minorities. They also report news about Christian persecutions around the world. For example, in this article:A DARK REALITY—CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN 73 COUNTRIES FACE HIDDEN PERSECUTION EVERY DAY,they write a detailed and compelling account of the persecution of Christians, but they do not provide a single link or source to validate these claims. Sadly, these claims may be true, but the reader has no way of knowing without further unnecessary research. In another article that you can view here, they again do not provide linked evidence, but rather offer prayers. Open Doors has rarely been criticized for not delivering donated to money to their causes, but according to theOrange County Register“A campaign for Open Doors With Brother Andrew of Santa Ana raised $7,753 – of which the charity got $7.75.” In general, Open Doors is considered a reputable charity with an 88% rating fromCharity Navigator. While they obviously hold pro-Christian views, they do not publish politics on their website but rather focus on Christian Persecution and the establishment of Christianity in places that are currently hostile.",

    "analysis": "These sources have minimal bias and use very few loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by appeals to emotion or stereotypes).  The reporting is factual and usually sourced.  These are the most credible media sources.See all Least Biased Sources. Open aims to maintain a neutral and balanced stance in its reporting, covering various topics and presenting multiple viewpoints. The platform is known for its fact-checking initiative, which addresses misinformation and provides accurate information to the public. Their detailed fact-checking reports on viral social media claims demonstrate a thorough approach to ensuring accuracy. An example of their work is the article“Giorgia Meloni’s Irony: Social Column Telemeloni Video,”which reports on Meloni’s social media broadcast. PMGiorgia Meloni(far right) uses the broadcast to respond to various political issues and criticisms, including alleged government pressure on Rai and criticisms from Elly Schlein. This coverage exemplifies Open’s commitment to providing context and countering potential misinformation by directly presenting Meloni’s viewpoints. Another example is the article“Inflazione al 5,7%, Urso esulta: ‘Pieno successo del “carrello tricolore,”‘”which analyzes the latest inflation data from Istat and presents various perspectives. It uses emotionally loaded language, such as “esulta” (rejoices) and “pagliacciata” (farce), indicating a critical tone toward the government’s narrative. Adolfo Urso, Italy’s Minister of Enterprises, celebrated the perceived success of the “carrello tricolore” initiative, which aimed to control the prices of certain essential goods to combat inflation. Urso’s positive reaction illustrates his belief that the initiative effectively helped to reduce inflation rates, as reported by Istat. In the article, Urso’s statement is contrasted with critical perspectives, particularly from consumer associations and opposition politicians, who argue that the initiative did not significantly impact food prices. The word “esulta” suggests Urso’s celebratory tone regarding the inflation data. The article cites multiple sources, including Istat and Eurostat data, government statements, and critical responses from consumer associations and opposition politicians, providing a balanced view of the issue. Open generally demonstrates a commitment to comprehensive and factual reporting while occasionally exhibiting bias in its political coverage, particularly when addressing potential misinformation or controversial statements from right-wing figures like Giorgia Meloni. Their critical tone towards the current right-wing ruling party reflects their role in scrutinizing those in power. If the political landscape were different, their focus would shift accordingly. They are also a certified fact-checker.",

OnTheWight covers a variety of topics related to the Isle of Wight community. Their reporting includes local news, events, politics, and community issues. For instance, they emphasize community-focused stories, like thecollaboration between Tesco and Isle of Wight residentsfor a food allergy awareness campaign. Further, they provide detailed reports on local infrastructure projects, such as the“Southern Water details £21.5 million investment in Isle of Wight infrastructure over five years.” Additionally, they publish reports such as“Bonchurch Landslide: Leeson Road – Comprehensive Report from Public Meeting,”which covers a public meeting discussing a landslide in Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, affecting Leeson Road. The report includes detailed accounts from officials and residents about the causes, impacts, and potential solutions for the landslide. Key points include concerns about road safety, infrastructure damage, and proposed measures to prevent future incidents. The article aims to summarize the meeting thoroughly, reflecting community involvement and local government responses. It is informative and focused on local issues, presenting facts and statements from the meeting without noticeable bias. In contrast, their political coverage can show bias in wording and framing. For example, the article“Letter: HS2 – A casualty of Brexit or Tory mismanagement?”suggests a critical view of Brexit and the Conservative Party. The title and content use terms like “casualty” and “mismanagement,” which carry negative connotations and imply a failure on the part of the government. The framing directs readers to consider Brexit and the Conservative administration as primary reasons for the HS2 project’s difficulties without presenting counterarguments or diverse perspectives indicating a left-leaning bias, focusing on political critique rather than a balanced analysis. In conclusion, OnTheWight demonstrates a mix of neutral reporting on community and infrastructure topics and comprehensive and factual reporting on local issues while occasionally exhibiting left-leaning bias in its political coverage.",

Under Good Daily, the network was widely criticized for using fabricated testimonials and concealing its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate content. According toNieman Lab, the newsletters operated under a false pretense of local community connection while being entirely automated from New York. Following theacquisition by 6AM City, fake testimonials were removed, and the new owner committed to gradually aligning the newsletters with its editorial and ethical standards. However, Daily Cedar Park remains AI-generated and unedited by human staff. The newsletter is based in Cedar Park, Texas; however, 6AM City is run out of South Carolina, despite its emphasis on local communities. Read our profile on the United States Media and Government.",

The site states that it assumes no responsibility for the accuracy or legality of content on external websites linked through these affiliate relationships, shifting that responsibility to the advertisers or sponsors. Because Health Insider frequently publishes product reviews and health-related guides that include direct purchase links, this revenue model presents a potential conflict of interest, as financial incentives may influence editorial framing, product selection, or the emphasis placed on benefits over limitations in reviewed items.",
    "analysis": "Health Insider presents itself as evidence-based, but much of its content blends legitimate health information with consumer-oriented product promotion. For example, theShleep reviewis written in a first-person testimonial style, includes a star rating, pricing information, and direct purchase links, and largely emphasizes benefits whiledownplaying limitations. In topical articles such as“Rice Water for Hair,” the site accurately notes that evidence is limited yetframes traditional remedies in an implicitly favorable light while monetizing adjacent products. Similarly, the articleHow to Lose 50 Pounds in a Monthuses a misleading headline while later acknowledging that such weight loss is unrealistic, a common tactic used to attract traffic while soft-correcting within the article body. Although articles frequently cite medical concepts and include MD bylines, sourcing is often generalized, selective, or secondary, and the commercial framing undermines editorial independence.
